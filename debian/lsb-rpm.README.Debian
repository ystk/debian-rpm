This package is intended to be used to build RPM v3 packages that are LSB
compliant. It provides a /usr/bin/lsb-rpm program, that can only be used to
build (not query or install) RPM v3 packages. (rpm currently builds RPM v3
packages by default, but should that change, lsb-rpm will continue to build
v3 packages.)

Use regular rpm for querying, installation, etc. The lsb-rpm binary is
statically linked, so it will work in the lsbdev environment.
